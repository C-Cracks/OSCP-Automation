1. Who do we have access as?
  set | whoami /all
  
2. Do we have the ability to access Administrator files?
  dir \Users\Administrator
  
3. How can we transfer files?
  https://www.abatchy.com/2017/03/powershell-download-file-one-liners | wget | certutil | curl | smb | ftp

4. Check for weak config

  whoami /all | net user username 
    SeImpersonate | SeDebug | SeTakeOwnership | SeLoadDriver | SeCreateToken | SeRestore | SeAssignPrimary | SeTcb

  cmdkey /list
    if admin credentials stored, use CredMan.ps1 if possible
    powershell -C ".\CredMan.ps1 -ShoCred"
  schtasks
    check scheduled tasks
  use icacls on Windows, Program Files etc to see if we have write permission

5. Check if the machine is vulnerable to any publicly known exploits via Watson (exe in this directory)
